# 5 Day Weather Forecast

[My website](https://nuclearreid.github.io/weatherApi/)

This is a simple 5 day forecast application. The user can type in the name of a city and they will be given the 5 day forecast.
These days include the current day and the next 4 days. 
The previous city searches are stored in the local storage, displayed on the page, and can be clicked on to get the weather.
The background of the cards for each of the days updates depending on the weather conditions of that day. (ie dark blue if raining, white if snow, etc)
 
I used the OpenWeather 5 day / 3 hour forecast data to retrieve the info displayed on the page. The images used to represent the weather conditions also came form the OpenWeather website.

For my questions about JavaScript, JQuery, HTML, or CSS I predominently used the Microsoft Copilot AI and for questions with Bootstrap, I used the Bootstrap documentation.
